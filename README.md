Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.

**Problem Statement:** You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Main Objective

## Data Understanding
 The dataset used for this anaysis was downloaded from different box offices. The data was was acquired from Box Office MojoLinks, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, The Numbers. The data contains information about movies that have posted in box offices. The data has two files: idmb movie ratings and basics and boom movies gross .The whole combined data has 2447 rows and 12 columns.The data has the following set of information about movie:

## Data Preparation
Before analyzing the data had to be processed and cleaned. The data was checked for null values and also duplicates. This data had a few columns tha had missing or null valuesand we had to delete the rows to preserve the important information. Some Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) was done to the data to determine if there was any patterns in the data. This data had one categorical column, meaning that these columns had to be converted to numeric features in order to be used in evaluation. The categorical columns was then changed from object to float. This data was then ready for evaluation.

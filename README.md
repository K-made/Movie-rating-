Before analyzing the data had to be processed and cleaned. The data was checked for null values and also duplicates. This data had a few columns tha had missing or null valuesand we had to delete the rows to preserve the important information. Some Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) was done to the data to determine if there was any patterns in the data. This data had one categorical column, meaning that these columns had to be converted to numeric features in order to be used in evaluation. The categorical columns was then changed from object to float. This data was then ready for evaluation.
